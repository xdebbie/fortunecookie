You can only open 1 cookie every 2 hours.

The PHP file contains a small database of the fortunes and the Javascript handles the fortune reveal and the cooldown management.

## **_The project_**

This PHP mini-experiment was deployed on Heroku since GitHub won't handle PHP. The objective of this little project was to practice the integration between PHP and Javascript, the deployment of web-apps using Composer on Heroku and the implementation of a 7-1 directory structure on SASS.
